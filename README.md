# COSC 81/281 robot project

Start with [Setup and testing](docs/SETUP.md). This repository supplies the ROS 2 baseline students build, modify and extend, together with a starter navigation program and a PC viewer.

## Two computers, two workspaces

You will work on two computers. Each one gets its own copy of this repository, but builds and runs a different folder inside it:

| Computer | What it is | Folder it builds and runs | What that folder does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **The Jetson** | The small computer mounted on the robot. You log into it over SSH. | `robot/` | Runs the robot: sensors, motors, safety checks and your navigation code. |
| **Your PC** | Your own laptop or lab computer. | `viewer/` | Shows the robot's live camera and telemetry in RViz. It does not drive the robot. |

Each of those two folders is a ROS workspace: a folder with a `src/` directory that you build with colcon. You build `robot/` only on the Jetson and `viewer/` only on your PC.

└── LICENSE                     # MIT
```

Both computers clone the same repository, so the Jetson will also have a `viewer/` folder and your PC will also have a `robot/` folder. Leave the other computer's folder unbuilt. Never run colcon from the repository root: `robot/` and `viewer/` each contain their own copy of the interface packages, and building them together fails.

When built, each workspace creates its own `build/`, `install/` and `log/` folders inside itself. Git ignores these generated folders. There is no separate `~/ros2_ws` and no source-copy step.

The viewer is optional: only one person per team needs to be able to build it. Everyone else can work entirely over SSH, saving or recording data on the Jetson and copying files to their PC with `scp`. RViz is worth having on one machine because seeing the camera and telemetry live makes debugging much easier.

## Get the repository

In a terminal on each machine:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/plancherb1/cosc-281-f26-project.git a2r-student
```

The repository is public, so no GitHub sign-in is needed. If the Jetson has no internet access, the [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md#2-clone-the-repository-on-the-jetson) shows how to copy your PC clone to it instead. If `~/a2r-student` already exists, inspect it before cloning or updating; keep your own edits.

## Get Started with docs/SETUP.md

1. Follow [wiring and connection checks](docs/SETUP.md#hardware-connections-and-pinout).
2. On the **Jetson**, follow [the robot build](docs/SETUP.md#build-the-robot-workspace-on-the-jetson). This builds the baseline, both message packages and student program together in `robot/`.
3. Follow [the disabled-first launch](docs/SETUP.md#first-launch-motors-disabled), then [sensor and communication checks](docs/SETUP.md#run-the-student-program).
4. On **one team member's PC**, follow [viewer setup](viewer/README.md) and verify live robot data over the assigned router. This step is optional for everyone else.
5. Complete [controlled movement/stopping](docs/SETUP.md#controlled-movement-and-stopping-check) and [calibration](docs/SETUP.md#encoder-calibration-and-geometry).
6. If you have time, try [making your first autonomous node](docs/SETUP.md#getting-started-with-autonomy).
7. Finish with [stop, restore and record](docs/SETUP.md#stop-restore-and-record) and the [end of session shutdown](docs/SETUP.md#end-of-session-shutdown).

The lab Jetsons already have their commissioned OS, firmware, ROS Jazzy, `~/ros-venv`, identity/network settings and standalone camera/OLED services. [Prerequisite checks](docs/SETUP.md#check-the-commissioned-prerequisites) verify those before building. You build the ROS baseline yourself. If a prerequisite check fails, ask the teaching staff; it is not something to fix by rebuilding your code.

## Connection details

| Connection | Name / username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi | Robot 1: `a2r-projects`; robots 2–5: `a2r-projects-N` | See Canvas |
| 5 GHz Wi-Fi | Assigned SSID with `_5G` appended | See Canvas |
| SSH, all robots | `a2r-lab-jetson` | See Canvas |

Replace `N` with the robot number. Use the IP on the robot's OLED:

```bash
ssh a2r-lab-jetson@ROBOT_IP
```

The passwords are posted on Canvas, not in this public repository. Keep them, and your personal GitHub keys, out of commits and off shared robots.
